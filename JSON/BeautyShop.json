Trust us, we always know when your skin hasn’t been well-cared for. Makeup needs a hydrated, healthy base and skincare is, therefore, a must. Get a personalised consultation from a dermatologist at least a few months before the big day. Also, please get your eyebrows shaped the way you want, double cleanse your face right before you sit for your makeup and come with confidence and trust in your artist.</span>"

      "title": "Beauty Shop: What’s the one thing all brides must keep in mind before starting their makeup? <span><b>Navya:</b> I like to prep the skin before I apply the base with Charlotte’s Magic Cream. It immediately plumps up the skin and makes it ready for makeup. Next, I use the Hollywood Filter as a primer. It’s a beautiful, innovative product that adds a ‘megawatt glow’ to your skin and makes the perfect base for your foundation.  My go-to foundation is the Airbush Flawless foundation. With Charlotte Tilbury’s ‘magic matrix of ingredients’ (that includes Replexium, MossCellTec no. 1, and AirCool,  all patented by CT), this foundation is weightless, and hydrating that makes your skin look fresh and perfect.</span>"
