            At Shoppers Stop, we believe in limitless possibilities and have
            always set high benchmarks, achieved the impossible and celebrated
            our successes. With innovation at our core, we adopted our
            philosophy of ‘Start Something New’ in order to give retail a whole
            new dimension. We endeavour to Start Something New in performance,
            in products, customer service, and in life.

            All our employees are designated as Customer Care Associates; this
            implies that we are, first and foremost, dedicated to serving our
            customers. This not only creates a service oriented mind-set within
            our employees but it also reinforces the feeling that we are all
            partners working towards a common goal.

            Our company anthem, “Hadh Se Aage” is played across our
            organization, from our head office and regional offices to stores
            and distribution centres, at 9.45 A.M. every morning. This song,
            composed by Javed Akhtar and sung by Sonu Nigam, is sung
            wholeheartedly by all our employees with the lyrics encouraging and
            inspiring us to make meaningful contributions to society.

          We have come a long way from our very first store in 1991 to over 89
          stores all across the country. Our journey, complete with ups and
          downs, has been incredible and we will keep growing faster as we
          collaborate with different brands, develop our own private labels and
          continue to serve our loyal customers.

                You may cancel your order or some products in your order before we bill and ship them. We request you to connect with us immediately after placing the order if you wish to cancel part of your order. In case we receive a
                cancelation request after billing or after the products have been shipped, we will send a cancelation request to our stores/warehouse/vendor, asking them not to dispatch the products and arrange for a refund accordingly.

      <p>
        
                However, in the interim, if the product has already been handed over to our courier partner and is in transit or out for delivery, we request you to refuse the delivery of your order. The refund for the refused order will be
                initiated once the products come back to our store/warehouse.
            
      </p>

                Despite our best efforts, a small number of products in our extensive catalogue may be mispriced. However, we verify prices as part of our dispatch procedures. If the correct price of the product is lower than our stated
                price, we shall process a refund of the price difference and send you the product. If a product's correct price is higher than our stated price, we may cancel your order and notify you about cancelation. SSBeauty.in shall
                have the right, at its sole discretion, to cancel or dispatch the orders placed for that product.

                While we work hard to fulfil your order to the best of our ability, there may be a possibility that while procuring the product from our stores/warehouse/vendor the product may be out of stock or not in saleable condition.
                In such situations, if we are unable to process your order completely, we shall cancel the products, and send an email to you informing you about the same.

                In order to provide a safe and secure shopping experience, we regularly monitor transactions for fraudulent activity. If any suspicious activity is identified, SSBeauty.in reserves the right to cancel the order or upcoming

                We will do our best to provide the same pricing across both our SSBeauty Stores and online site. However, sometimes the prices online may not match the prices in our store(s) and vice versa due to special or exceptional
                promotions/events offered for a specific store or online for a specific period. The prices and availability of the products are subject to change without notice.

                While SSBeauty strives to provide accurate product and pricing information on the website and app, pricing, typographical or mispricing errors may occur. SSBeauty.in cannot confirm the price of a product until the order is
                received. If a product is listed at a mispriced or incorrect price or with incorrect information due to an error in pricing or product information, SSBeauty.in shall have the right, at its sole discretion to refuse, cancel
                or call back (if dispatched) the orders placed for that product.

                For cancelations, the payment for prepaid orders shall be processed to the same payment mode that was used while placing the order or to the SS Wallet. The refund for the Cash-on-Delivery (COD) orders is not applicable since
                the payment has not been made yet.
            
      </p>
      
            
      <p>
        For returns, the amount will be refunded in the payment mode that was selected at the time of raising the return request.

      <p>
        Any promotional voucher used for the canceled orders may not be refunded. Orders placed for the First Citizen Membership, Gift Cards or E-Gift Vouchers cannot be canceled or returned.

              For our 30th Foundation Year, we aimed at serving 300,000 meals to our
                        labourer
                        families across India.
                        One of our core values is to be socially responsible and we wanted to make a difference in the
                        lives
                        of
                        our people and our communities. By helping those within our Shoppers Stop family, we would
                        ultimately be
                        benefitting society at large.

              We donated 1644 ration kits and 394,560 meals all over India through the
                        extraordinary efforts of our volunteers from our stores and head office.

                On Women’s Day, we extended our support to women across the country to spread awareness on the
                importance of
                menstrual hygiene and sanitization. Women have the strength and the power to transform the world. We are
                extremely proud of all our women associates who are the heart of our business. So, we decided to
                acknowledge
                the important roles women play in our lives both at home and at work.

           We tied up
                with
                several NGOs across
                the country to organize awareness drives, distribute sanitary napkins, conduct wellness workshops and
                financial management seminars.

              We tied up with WWF to conduct the Plant-A-Tree Campaign as part of ‘Daan Utsav’.
                        We organized the
                        Plant-A-Tree campaign at both our head office and across all our stores. Together, our
                        associates
                        planted 4000 trees pan India, truly bettering our environment for future generations.

                In association with Goonj, we celebrated ‘Daan Utsav’ with the Book Donation Drive. We believe that when
                you
                donate your books, whether theyend up in the hands of a young teen looking for an exciting new story to
                read or become part of a collection on a bookshelf, they can make a long-lasting impact on someone’s
                life.
                We ran the Book Donation drive across all our stores across the country and at our head office and our
                associates donated 10019 books from all over India.

                        We undertook this initiative to spread joy to the lives of our housekeeping and
                        security staff as well as those in need all over India. Diwali is the festival of lights
                        and what better way to celebrate it than by lighting up the lives of those people
                        who work endlessly through the year and especially through the festive season.
                        We wanted to make it special for our associates, our housekeeping staff and our security.

                        We decorated our offices with eco-friendly and handmade kandils and diyas and
                        ensured we made the season special for our helping staff at the workplace. Each
                        zone took it on themselves to make donations to the needy, orphanages and old
                        age homes in their area.

            SSBeauty will never e-mail or call a customer and ask that they disclose or verify their Platform password, credit card, or banking account number. Such information should only be submitted on the web page forms, when completing an order on the Platform or when making updates to Your Account areas and never on phone or e-mail to us. If you receive a suspicious e-mail with a link to update your account information, do not click on the link--instead go directly to

            If you are contacted by, or receive an unsolicited e-mail from an unknown entity impersonating as SSBeauty or any of its sister concerns or associates, and are asked to confirm or provide your password or personal or banking information, simply disregard the request and report the incident to SSBeauty for investigation.

            Customers should always carefully review order and shipment confirmation e-mails to ensure that they are legitimate and have been sent by SSBeauty. To do this, simply cross-check confirmation e-mails with the transaction history found in your account area. If you receive shipment confirmation e-mail for a transaction you have not done, report the incident to SSBeauty.

            All our employees are designated as Customer Care Associates; this
            implies that we are, first and foremost, dedicated to serving our
            customers. This not only creates a service oriented mind-set within
            our employees but it also reinforces the feeling that we are all
            partners working towards a common goal.

          We have come a long way from our very first store in 1991 to over 89
          stores all across the country. Our journey, complete with ups and
          downs, has been incredible and we will keep growing faster as we
          collaborate with different brands, develop our own private labels and
          continue to serve our loyal customers.

                You may cancel your order or some products in your order before we bill and ship them. We request you to connect with us immediately after placing the order if you wish to cancel part of your order. In case we receive a
                cancelation request after billing or after the products have been shipped, we will send a cancelation request to our stores/warehouse/vendor, asking them not to dispatch the products and arrange for a refund accordingly.
            
      </p>
      
            
      <p>
        
                However, in the interim, if the product has already been handed over to our courier partner and is in transit or out for delivery, we request you to refuse the delivery of your order. The refund for the refused order will be
                initiated once the products come back to our store/warehouse.
            
      </p>
      
            
      <p>
        You may also exchange or return the product(s) as per the Return/Exchange policy in an unused, saleable condition in its original packaging along with original tags within 15 days from the date the delivery was accepted.

      <p>
        
                Despite our best efforts, a small number of products in our extensive catalogue may be mispriced. However, we verify prices as part of our dispatch procedures. If the correct price of the product is lower than our stated
                price, we shall process a refund of the price difference and send you the product. If a product's correct price is higher than our stated price, we may cancel your order and notify you about cancelation. SSBeauty.in shall
                have the right, at its sole discretion, to cancel or dispatch the orders placed for that product.

      <p>
        
                While we work hard to fulfil your order to the best of our ability, there may be a possibility that while procuring the product from our stores/warehouse/vendor the product may be out of stock or not in saleable condition.
                In such situations, if we are unable to process your order completely, we shall cancel the products, and send an email to you informing you about the same.

        Cancelation Of Fraudulent Orders

      <p>
        
                In order to provide a safe and secure shopping experience, we regularly monitor transactions for fraudulent activity. If any suspicious activity is identified, SSBeauty.in reserves the right to cancel the order or upcoming
                orders without any liability.

      <p>
        
                We will do our best to provide the same pricing across both our SSBeauty Stores and online site. However, sometimes the prices online may not match the prices in our store(s) and vice versa due to special or exceptional
                promotions/events offered for a specific store or online for a specific period. The prices and availability of the products are subject to change without notice.

                While SSBeauty strives to provide accurate product and pricing information on the website and app, pricing, typographical or mispricing errors may occur. SSBeauty.in cannot confirm the price of a product until the order is
                received. If a product is listed at a mispriced or incorrect price or with incorrect information due to an error in pricing or product information, SSBeauty.in shall have the right, at its sole discretion to refuse, cancel
                or call back (if dispatched) the orders placed for that product.

      <p>
        
                For cancelations, the payment for prepaid orders shall be processed to the same payment mode that was used while placing the order or to the SS Wallet. The refund for the Cash-on-Delivery (COD) orders is not applicable since
                the payment has not been made yet.
            
      </p>
      
            
      <p>
        For returns, the amount will be refunded in the payment mode that was selected at the time of raising the return request.
      </p>
      
            
      <p>
        Any promotional voucher used for the canceled orders may not be refunded. Orders placed for the First Citizen Membership, Gift Cards or E-Gift Vouchers cannot be canceled or returned.

              For our 30th Foundation Year, we aimed at serving 300,000 meals to our
                        labourer
                        families across India.
                        One of our core values is to be socially responsible and we wanted to make a difference in the
                        lives
                        of
                        our people and our communities. By helping those within our Shoppers Stop family, we would
                        ultimately be
                        benefitting society at large.

              We donated 1644 ration kits and 394,560 meals all over India through the

                On Women’s Day, we extended our support to women across the country to spread awareness on the
                importance of
                menstrual hygiene and sanitization. Women have the strength and the power to transform the world. We are
                extremely proud of all our women associates who are the heart of our business. So, we decided to
                acknowledge
                the important roles women play in our lives both at home and at work.

                with
                several NGOs across
                the country to organize awareness drives, distribute sanitary napkins, conduct wellness workshops and
                financial management seminars.

              We tied up with WWF to conduct the Plant-A-Tree Campaign as part of ‘Daan Utsav’.
                        We organized the
                        Plant-A-Tree campaign at both our head office and across all our stores. Together, our
                        associates
                        planted 4000 trees pan India, truly bettering our environment for future generations.

                In association with Goonj, we celebrated ‘Daan Utsav’ with the Book Donation Drive. We believe that when
                you
                donate your books, whether theyend up in the hands of a young teen looking for an exciting new story to
                read or become part of a collection on a bookshelf, they can make a long-lasting impact on someone’s
                life.
                We ran the Book Donation drive across all our stores across the country and at our head office and our
                associates donated 10019 books from all over India.

                        We undertook this initiative to spread joy to the lives of our housekeeping and
                        security staff as well as those in need all over India. Diwali is the festival of lights
                        and what better way to celebrate it than by lighting up the lives of those people
                        who work endlessly through the year and especially through the festive season.
                        We wanted to make it special for our associates, our housekeeping staff and our security.

                        We decorated our offices with eco-friendly and handmade kandils and diyas and
                        ensured we made the season special for our helping staff at the workplace. Each
                        zone took it on themselves to make donations to the needy, orphanages and old
                        age homes in their area.

                    Conservation Day recognizes that a healthy environment is the foundation for a stable and productive
                    society
                    and enables us to realize that the responsibility to protect the environment and conserve resources
                    like
                    water, fuel and electricity to ensure the well-being of present and future generations lies with us.

                    birds,

            SSBeauty will never e-mail or call a customer and ask that they disclose or verify their Platform password, credit card, or banking account number. Such information should only be submitted on the web page forms, when completing an order on the Platform or when making updates to Your Account areas and never on phone or e-mail to us. If you receive a suspicious e-mail with a link to update your account information, do not click on the link--instead go directly to 
            <a
              class="link"

            If you are contacted by, or receive an unsolicited e-mail from an unknown entity impersonating as SSBeauty or any of its sister concerns or associates, and are asked to confirm or provide your password or personal or banking information, simply disregard the request and report the incident to SSBeauty for investigation.
          </li>

            Customers should always carefully review order and shipment confirmation e-mails to ensure that they are legitimate and have been sent by SSBeauty. To do this, simply cross-check confirmation e-mails with the transaction history found in your account area. If you receive shipment confirmation e-mail for a transaction you have not done, report the incident to SSBeauty.
          </li>

            All our employees are designated as Customer Care Associates; this
            implies that we are, first and foremost, dedicated to serving our
            customers. This not only creates a service oriented mind-set within
            our employees but it also reinforces the feeling that we are all
            partners working towards a common goal.

          We have come a long way from our very first store in 1991 to over 89
          stores all across the country. Our journey, complete with ups and
          downs, has been incredible and we will keep growing faster as we
          collaborate with different brands, develop our own private labels and
          continue to serve our loyal customers.

                You may cancel your order or some products in your order before we bill and ship them. We request you to connect with us immediately after placing the order if you wish to cancel part of your order. In case we receive a
                cancelation request after billing or after the products have been shipped, we will send a cancelation request to our stores/warehouse/vendor, asking them not to dispatch the products and arrange for a refund accordingly.

      <p>
        
                However, in the interim, if the product has already been handed over to our courier partner and is in transit or out for delivery, we request you to refuse the delivery of your order. The refund for the refused order will be
                initiated once the products come back to our store/warehouse.

                Despite our best efforts, a small number of products in our extensive catalogue may be mispriced. However, we verify prices as part of our dispatch procedures. If the correct price of the product is lower than our stated
                price, we shall process a refund of the price difference and send you the product. If a product's correct price is higher than our stated price, we may cancel your order and notify you about cancelation. SSBeauty.in shall
                have the right, at its sole discretion, to cancel or dispatch the orders placed for that product.

                While we work hard to fulfil your order to the best of our ability, there may be a possibility that while procuring the product from our stores/warehouse/vendor the product may be out of stock or not in saleable condition.
                In such situations, if we are unable to process your order completely, we shall cancel the products, and send an email to you informing you about the same.

                promotions/events offered for a specific store or online for a specific period. The prices and availability of the products are subject to change without notice.

                While SSBeauty strives to provide accurate product and pricing information on the website and app, pricing, typographical or mispricing errors may occur. SSBeauty.in cannot confirm the price of a product until the order is
                received. If a product is listed at a mispriced or incorrect price or with incorrect information due to an error in pricing or product information, SSBeauty.in shall have the right, at its sole discretion to refuse, cancel
                or call back (if dispatched) the orders placed for that product.

      <p>
        
                For cancelations, the payment for prepaid orders shall be processed to the same payment mode that was used while placing the order or to the SS Wallet. The refund for the Cash-on-Delivery (COD) orders is not applicable since
                the payment has not been made yet.
            
      </p>
      
            
      <p>
        For returns, the amount will be refunded in the payment mode that was selected at the time of raising the return request.

      <p>
        Any promotional voucher used for the canceled orders may not be refunded. Orders placed for the First Citizen Membership, Gift Cards or E-Gift Vouchers cannot be canceled or returned.

              For our 30th Foundation Year, we aimed at serving 300,000 meals to our
                        labourer
                        families across India.
                        One of our core values is to be socially responsible and we wanted to make a difference in the
                        lives
                        of
                        our people and our communities. By helping those within our Shoppers Stop family, we would
                        ultimately be
                        benefitting society at large.

              We donated 1644 ration kits and 394,560 meals all over India through the

                On Women’s Day, we extended our support to women across the country to spread awareness on the
                importance of
                menstrual hygiene and sanitization. Women have the strength and the power to transform the world. We are
                extremely proud of all our women associates who are the heart of our business. So, we decided to
                acknowledge
                the important roles women play in our lives both at home and at work.

           We tied up
                with
                several NGOs across
                the country to organize awareness drives, distribute sanitary napkins, conduct wellness workshops and
                financial management seminars.

              We tied up with WWF to conduct the Plant-A-Tree Campaign as part of ‘Daan Utsav’.
                        We organized the
                        Plant-A-Tree campaign at both our head office and across all our stores. Together, our
                        associates
                        planted 4000 trees pan India, truly bettering our environment for future generations.

                In association with Goonj, we celebrated ‘Daan Utsav’ with the Book Donation Drive. We believe that when
                you
                donate your books, whether theyend up in the hands of a young teen looking for an exciting new story to
                read or become part of a collection on a bookshelf, they can make a long-lasting impact on someone’s
                life.
                We ran the Book Donation drive across all our stores across the country and at our head office and our
                associates donated 10019 books from all over India.

                        We undertook this initiative to spread joy to the lives of our housekeeping and
                        security staff as well as those in need all over India. Diwali is the festival of lights
                        and what better way to celebrate it than by lighting up the lives of those people
                        who work endlessly through the year and especially through the festive season.
                        We wanted to make it special for our associates, our housekeeping staff and our security.

                        ensured we made the season special for our helping staff at the workplace. Each
                        zone took it on themselves to make donations to the needy, orphanages and old
                        age homes in their area.

            All our employees are designated as Customer Care Associates; this
            implies that we are, first and foremost, dedicated to serving our
            customers. This not only creates a service oriented mind-set within
            our employees but it also reinforces the feeling that we are all
            partners working towards a common goal.

            and distribution centres, at 9.45 A.M. every morning. This song,
            composed by Javed Akhtar and sung by Sonu Nigam, is sung
            wholeheartedly by all our employees with the lyrics encouraging and

          We have come a long way from our very first store in 1991 to over 89
          stores all across the country. Our journey, complete with ups and
          downs, has been incredible and we will keep growing faster as we
          collaborate with different brands, develop our own private labels and
          continue to serve our loyal customers.

            All our employees are designated as Customer Care Associates; this
            implies that we are, first and foremost, dedicated to serving our
            customers. This not only creates a service oriented mind-set within
            our employees but it also reinforces the feeling that we are all
            partners working towards a common goal.

            Our company anthem, “Hadh Se Aage” is played across our
            organization, from our head office and regional offices to stores
            and distribution centres, at 9.45 A.M. every morning. This song,
            composed by Javed Akhtar and sung by Sonu Nigam, is sung
            wholeheartedly by all our employees with the lyrics encouraging and

          We have come a long way from our very first store in 1991 to over 89
          stores all across the country. Our journey, complete with ups and
          downs, has been incredible and we will keep growing faster as we
          collaborate with different brands, develop our own private labels and
          continue to serve our loyal customers.

            All our employees are designated as Customer Care Associates; this
            implies that we are, first and foremost, dedicated to serving our
            customers. This not only creates a service oriented mind-set within
            our employees but it also reinforces the feeling that we are all
            partners working towards a common goal.

            Our company anthem, “Hadh Se Aage” is played across our
            organization, from our head office and regional offices to stores
            and distribution centres, at 9.45 A.M. every morning. This song,
            composed by Javed Akhtar and sung by Sonu Nigam, is sung
            wholeheartedly by all our employees with the lyrics encouraging and
            inspiring us to make meaningful contributions to society.

            customers. This not only creates a service oriented mind-set within
            our employees but it also reinforces the feeling that we are all
            partners working towards a common goal.

          We have come a long way from our very first store in 1991 to over 89
          stores all across the country. Our journey, complete with ups and
          downs, has been incredible and we will keep growing faster as we
          collaborate with different brands, develop our own private labels and
          continue to serve our loyal customers.

            All our employees are designated as Customer Care Associates; this
            implies that we are, first and foremost, dedicated to serving our
            customers. This not only creates a service oriented mind-set within
            our employees but it also reinforces the feeling that we are all
            partners working towards a common goal.

          We have come a long way from our very first store in 1991 to over 89
          stores all across the country. Our journey, complete with ups and
          downs, has been incredible and we will keep growing faster as we
          collaborate with different brands, develop our own private labels and
          continue to serve our loyal customers.

            All our employees are designated as Customer Care Associates; this
            implies that we are, first and foremost, dedicated to serving our
            customers. This not only creates a service oriented mind-set within
            our employees but it also reinforces the feeling that we are all
            partners working towards a common goal.

          We have come a long way from our very first store in 1991 to over 89
          stores all across the country. Our journey, complete with ups and
          downs, has been incredible and we will keep growing faster as we
          collaborate with different brands, develop our own private labels and
          continue to serve our loyal customers.

            SSBeauty will never e-mail or call a customer and ask that they disclose or verify their Platform password, credit card, or banking account number. Such information should only be submitted on the web page forms, when completing an order on the Platform or when making updates to Your Account areas and never on phone or e-mail to us. If you receive a suspicious e-mail with a link to update your account information, do not click on the link--instead go directly to 
            <a

            If you are contacted by, or receive an unsolicited e-mail from an unknown entity impersonating as SSBeauty or any of its sister concerns or associates, and are asked to confirm or provide your password or personal or banking information, simply disregard the request and report the incident to SSBeauty for investigation.
          </li>

            Customers should always carefully review order and shipment confirmation e-mails to ensure that they are legitimate and have been sent by SSBeauty. To do this, simply cross-check confirmation e-mails with the transaction history found in your account area. If you receive shipment confirmation e-mail for a transaction you have not done, report the incident to SSBeauty.
          </li>
          
				
				
          <li
            class="list"

            Never disclose any confidential information such as passwords in any communication with us or with any of our employee. SSBeauty will never ask for such information over e-mails or on phone.

            A phishing email will normally have a tone of urgency – like "Your account will be temporarily suspended" and therefore please "Login to keep your account active." Please remember SSBeauty will NEVER send such emails to its customers.

                You may cancel your order or some products in your order before we bill and ship them. We request you to connect with us immediately after placing the order if you wish to cancel part of your order. In case we receive a
                cancelation request after billing or after the products have been shipped, we will send a cancelation request to our stores/warehouse/vendor, asking them not to dispatch the products and arrange for a refund accordingly.

      <p>
        
                However, in the interim, if the product has already been handed over to our courier partner and is in transit or out for delivery, we request you to refuse the delivery of your order. The refund for the refused order will be
                initiated once the products come back to our store/warehouse.

                have the right, at its sole discretion, to cancel or dispatch the orders placed for that product.

                For cancelations, the payment for prepaid orders shall be processed to the same payment mode that was used while placing the order or to the SS Wallet. The refund for the Cash-on-Delivery (COD) orders is not applicable since

        Any promotional voucher used for the canceled orders may not be refunded. Orders placed for the First Citizen Membership, Gift Cards or E-Gift Vouchers cannot be canceled or returned.

            All our employees are designated as Customer Care Associates; this
            implies that we are, first and foremost, dedicated to serving our
            customers. This not only creates a service oriented mind-set within

            Our company anthem, “Hadh Se Aage” is played across our
            organization, from our head office and regional offices to stores
            and distribution centres, at 9.45 A.M. every morning. This song,
            composed by Javed Akhtar and sung by Sonu Nigam, is sung
            wholeheartedly by all our employees with the lyrics encouraging and
            inspiring us to make meaningful contributions to society.

          We have come a long way from our very first store in 1991 to over 89
          stores all across the country. Our journey, complete with ups and
          downs, has been incredible and we will keep growing faster as we

            All our employees are designated as Customer Care Associates; this
            implies that we are, first and foremost, dedicated to serving our
            customers. This not only creates a service oriented mind-set within
            our employees but it also reinforces the feeling that we are all
            partners working towards a common goal.

            Our company anthem, “Hadh Se Aage” is played across our
            organization, from our head office and regional offices to stores
            and distribution centres, at 9.45 A.M. every morning. This song,
            composed by Javed Akhtar and sung by Sonu Nigam, is sung
            wholeheartedly by all our employees with the lyrics encouraging and

          We have come a long way from our very first store in 1991 to over 89
          stores all across the country. Our journey, complete with ups and
          downs, has been incredible and we will keep growing faster as we
          collaborate with different brands, develop our own private labels and
          continue to serve our loyal customers.

          We have come a long way from our very first store in 1991 to over 89
          stores all across the country. Our journey, complete with ups and
          downs, has been incredible and we will keep growing faster as we
          collaborate with different brands, develop our own private labels and
          continue to serve our loyal customers.

            SSBeauty will never e-mail or call a customer and ask that they disclose or verify their Platform password, credit card, or banking account number. Such information should only be submitted on the web page forms, when completing an order on the Platform or when making updates to Your Account areas and never on phone or e-mail to us.

            Customers should always carefully review order and shipment confirmation e-mails to ensure that they are legitimate and have been sent by SSBeauty. To do this, simply cross-check confirmation e-mails with the transaction history found in your account area. If you receive shipment confirmation e-mail for a transaction you have not done, report the incident to SSBeauty.

                cancelation request after billing or after the products have been shipped, we will send a cancelation request to our stores/warehouse/vendor, asking them not to dispatch the products and arrange for a refund accordingly.

      <p>
        
                However, in the interim, if the product has already been handed over to our courier partner and is in transit or out for delivery, we request you to refuse the delivery of your order. The refund for the refused order will be
                initiated once the products come back to our store/warehouse.
            
      </p>
      
            
      <p>
        You may also exchange or return the product(s) as per the Return/Exchange policy in an unused, saleable condition in its original packaging along with original tags within 15 days from the date the delivery was accepted.

        In Case Of Mispricing
      </p>
      
            
      <p>
        
                Despite our best efforts, a small number of products in our extensive catalogue may be mispriced. However, we verify prices as part of our dispatch procedures. If the correct price of the product is lower than our stated
                price, we shall process a refund of the price difference and send you the product. If a product's correct price is higher than our stated price, we may cancel your order and notify you about cancelation. SSBeauty.in shall
                have the right, at its sole discretion, to cancel or dispatch the orders placed for that product.

        Cancelation By SSBeauty.in
      </p>
      
            
      <p>
        
                While we work hard to fulfil your order to the best of our ability, there may be a possibility that while procuring the product from our stores/warehouse/vendor the product may be out of stock or not in saleable condition.
                In such situations, if we are unable to process your order completely, we shall cancel the products, and send an email to you informing you about the same.

        Cancelation Of Fraudulent Orders
      </p>
      
            
      <p>
        
                In order to provide a safe and secure shopping experience, we regularly monitor transactions for fraudulent activity. If any suspicious activity is identified, SSBeauty.in reserves the right to cancel the order or upcoming
                orders without any liability.
            
      </p>
      
            
      <p>
        
                We will do our best to provide the same pricing across both our SSBeauty Stores and online site. However, sometimes the prices online may not match the prices in our store(s) and vice versa due to special or exceptional
                promotions/events offered for a specific store or online for a specific period. The prices and availability of the products are subject to change without notice.

                While SSBeauty strives to provide accurate product and pricing information on the website and app, pricing, typographical or mispricing errors may occur. SSBeauty.in cannot confirm the price of a product until the order is
                received. If a product is listed at a mispriced or incorrect price or with incorrect information due to an error in pricing or product information, SSBeauty.in shall have the right, at its sole discretion to refuse, cancel
                or call back (if dispatched) the orders placed for that product.

      <p>
        
                For cancelations, the payment for prepaid orders shall be processed to the same payment mode that was used while placing the order or to the SS Wallet. The refund for the Cash-on-Delivery (COD) orders is not applicable since
                the payment has not been made yet.
            
      </p>

        For returns, the amount will be refunded in the payment mode that was selected at the time of raising the return request.

        Any promotional voucher used for the canceled orders may not be refunded. Orders placed for the First Citizen Membership, Gift Cards or E-Gift Vouchers cannot be canceled or returned.
